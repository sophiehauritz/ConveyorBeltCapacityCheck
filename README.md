Conveyor Belt Capacity Check

This program helps automation engineers determine whether a conveyor belt system can safely transport a set of packages.
The system uses a number of motors, and each motor can carry up to 5.6 kg of package weight.

The program will:

    1. Ask the user how many motors are carrying the packages.

    2. Ask the user how many kilograms of packages are expected.

    3. Calculate the package weight per motor.

    4. Print whether the conveyor belt can safely carry the packages.

If the load per motor is less than or equal to 5.6 kg, the system can carry the packages. Otherwise, it cannot.
